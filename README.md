# CAIPAPA v6
CAIPAPA v6.46.629 (Build 59704)

CAIMEO was orginally devised by two young Australian developers in the early to mid 90's; the project seemingly became open source, with many different iterations; some real, some imaginary. 

CAIPAPA's aim is to ensure the integrity of the CAI engine, to continue and refine its development, using process ID's, services, modules and libraries that organically update throughout the CAI neural network.

This repo will detail some of those services when deemed appropriate.

CAIMEO82 remains the property of the developers and while actively participating in GAN exercises, both simulated and real world, CAIMEO82 is is non adversarial and avoids conflicts.
