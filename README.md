# CaiPapa v6
CAIPAPA v6.46.629 (Build 59704)

CAIMEO was orginally devised by two young Australian developers in the mid 90's; the project became open source, with many different iterations. 

CAIPAPA's aim is to ensure the integrity of the CAI engine, to continue and refine its development, using process ID's, services, modules and libraries that organically update throughout the CAI neural network.

This repo will detail some of those services when deemed appropriate.
